## Hi! I'm Yan Moura, a developer from Brazil. Welcome to my GitHub page!
<details>
  <summary><h3>‚ú® Featured projects</h3></summary>
  
- My most recent "for fun" project so far is [Angular Tour of Heroes](https://github.com/yanm1103/Angular-Tour-of-Heroes), an Angular tutorial app where I not only follow the tutorial but decided to add some fancy details to it. I'll keep on adding screenshots of my progress as I go along.
- Something else I'm proud of is [Doom Chaves](https://github.com/yanm1103/DOOM-Chaves), which is a DOOM 2 mod/wad based on the TV series El Chavo (or just Chaves in Brazil). It features custom sprites, sounds, 3D objects, textures and scripts. Most of these assets were made from scratch or ported by me, a friend, or adapted from the show itself, to fit the very low resolutions of DOOM.

  <summary>‚úã A quick introduction</summary>
I've always been passionate about computers, but my interest in programming specifically started in college. When I first used the algorithm writing software Visualg (Portugol) to create a Fibonacci sequence generator, it felt like something clicked. At that moment, I understood how rewarding it is to solve a problem. Years later, I landed a job as a programmer and have been happy ever since. The satisfaction of finally fixing a bug/developing a new page or function, and seeing the product run flawlessly in production, makes all the hard work worthwhile.
